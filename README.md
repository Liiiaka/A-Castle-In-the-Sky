# A-Castle-In-the-Sky
A very simple Escape Game
A Castle in the Sky
A Unity Project by Alina Ohnesorge and Annika Richter
for “Introduction to Unity” and “Advanced Experiment Design and Programming in Unity”


When we started into the „Introduction to Unity“ course, we pretty soon decided on what our final project should be: An Escape Room in a rather cheesy setting. And that is exactly what we did. After finishing the Intro course, we decided to also do the Advanced course to learn even more.
Though the idea of a Escape Room isn't something new, we didn't want to just copy something already existing. 

We first created two prototypes of which the later version ended up being our first level. Here we experimented with dragging objects, using blender models and creating animations in Unity. We then used everything we learned in our second scene where we  worked with buttons and an input field and also added a start menu and an end screen.

We really like the “dreamy” look of our game, it turned out just as kitschy as we wanted. Nonetheless we do believe that the look could be improved, if we had invested more time and for example learned more about the Shader Graph in Universal Render Pipeline.
Even though the game is not really complicated and does not take very long to finish, we are very proud on what we achieved, because we did almost everything ourselves – with the help of YouTube tutorials (praise Brackeys), search engines and Unity's API.
Alina's favourite part of the project was animating doors and lids, Annika's favourite part was building the scene.

Dragging objects in 3D space was a huge challenge for us, we had to watch a couple of tutorials before finding a script which did exactly what we needed.
Another big challenge was the collab mode in Unity. On some days we spend hours debugging and figuring out why things look different on our laptops. Usually the problem could be solved easily, but sometimes finding the issue took forever. In one case we just needed to adapt the Game preview, which we found out after two very frustrating days.
For some reason we also could not use .blend files on Alina's laptop, Unity just couldn't export them to .fbx files itself. We solved this by exporting the files out of Blender manually and then using these.
We did start to implement an inventory, but decided that it would not be necessary for the game. This might be something to implement in a future version where one level is not just one room but multiple and carrying objects between these is necessary. 
In a future version we would like to include more and more novel riddles, but the few that we did were already complicated enough. As we spend a lot of time debugging, we were really happy once we had everything going the way it was planned and did not dare to add to many extra things – we were kinda scared of breaking things.
But we will certainly keep learning and trying – thank you for these two great courses and getting us started with Unity!

Every object you see in the two levels has been modelled in Blender by us.
The riddle and end quote are (obviously) stolen from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.

You can install our game on your Windows PC with the setup file. Please ignore all safety warnings – it's really just our little unity game. Find it here: https://tinyurl.com/acastleinthesky
